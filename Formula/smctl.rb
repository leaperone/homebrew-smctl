  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      Reading sensors works out of the box:
        smctl sensors

      Battery and fan control need the privileged daemon:
        sudo smctl daemon install

      IMPORTANT — after every upgrade, restart the daemon so the new version
      actually takes effect (upgrades swap binaries but never restart it):
        sudo smctl daemon restart

      To remove everything cleanly (restores system control of fans/charging):
        sudo smctl daemon uninstall
        brew uninstall smctl
    EOS
  end

  test do
    assert_match version.to_s, shell_output("#{bin}/smctl --version")
  end
end
